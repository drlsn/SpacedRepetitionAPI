I created the PageTree app to help me store my notes and rehearse them more easily, but there is still a lot of features lacking. 
One of the missing things is the one to get a list of flashcards, or just a single one at a item, based on a spaced repetition method of some sort.
It could really spare me some time if I want to practice knowledge I learned. 

- i decided to do it as a separate project / service / delivarable
- i want to focus on learning new technologies and concepts
- vertical slices / event driven architecture, docker, CI/CD, AWS, MS SQL, SQL/T-SQL, REST API, Minimal APIs, REST API, Redis, event broker - RabbitMQ, testing all layers (functional, performance, architecture)
